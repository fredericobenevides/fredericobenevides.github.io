            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Frederico Benevides. I’m a 38 years old Brazilian
              who lives in Bauru, SP, Brazil.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m a Software Engineer with more than 20 years of experience in
              IT. Before changing my career to Software Engineer, I worked as a
              Network Administrator. These allowed me to improve my knowledge in
              infra that helped me to manage many system’s configuration along
              my career.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a thought that we are able to teach and learn from
              experienced people to naive people. That's why I believe in team
              work to share knowledge to help each other improve ourselves. I am
              considered a problem solver and so I like challenges.
            </p>
