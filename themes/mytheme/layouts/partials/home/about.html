            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Frederico Benevides. I'm a Brazilian
              who lives in Mococa, SP, Brazil.
            </p>

            <p>
              Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with more than 20 years of experience in
              IT. I started my career to be a NetWork Administrator but later
              in 2006 I changed my career to be a Software Engineer. This decision
              helped me to be a better engineer since I also gained knowledge from
              infra to software.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm a person that believes in the team environment. I have a passion
              to try to help people to develop themselves. I believe that any knowledge
              need to be shared between a team environment so everyone can grow in the team.
